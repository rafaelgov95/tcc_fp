# FP-growth
This repository contains a C++11 implementation of the well-known FP-growth algorithm, published in the hope that it will be useful. I tested the code on three different samples and results were checked against [this other implementation](http://www.borgelt.net/fpgrowth.html) of the algorithm.

The files `fptree.hpp` and `fptree.cpp` contain the data structures and the algorithm, and `main.cpp` contains a few tests.

Compile the code using the appropriate options for C++11 (e.g. `-std=c++11` using g++).
